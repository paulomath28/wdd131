        <h3>Ecotourism</h3>
        <p class="eco">Ecotourism, also known as ecological tourism, is a branch of the tourism industry that uses natural and cultural heritage in a sustainable way. Its objective is to encourage environmental conservation and the formation of environmental awareness through the interpretation of the natural environment. Our club supports and encourages everyone to preserve and love nature, with responsibilities towards it. At Ecotourism, our clients and friends will have unforgettable moments with these experiences.
            Some essential features of ecotourism include:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Sustainability:</strong> Ecotourism seeks to balance development with environmental preservation. It promotes responsible and conscious practices.</li>
            <li><strong>Contact with Nature:</strong> Ecotourism activities take place in natural environments, such as forests, mountains, rivers, beaches and national parks.</li>
            <li><strong>Education:</strong> Guides and instructors often teach visitors about the importance of conservation and preservation of the environment.</li>
            <li><strong>Benefit for Local Communities:</strong> Ecotourism aims to improve the quality of life of local populations, involving them in tourist activities.</li>
